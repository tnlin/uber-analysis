Overall, I am very pleased with Uber's service. However, some things need to be addressed. They should be more strict on who is able to drive for them. I understand there is a minimum of driving record, but a full background check should be in order as well. I do believe any criminal activity documented as drivers past should be accounted for and they should not be behind the wheel. That being said, about a month ago I was on a ride with a couple of friends and I told the driver that I would verbally instruct him. He told me that I had to put in the address, though I had no address, or else he wouldn't get paid. I knew that was not true as none of my other drivers had had this issue with me before. He continued our ride as my friend was able to get an address, and I had told him we were dropping her off on the way to my apartment. Upon dropping her off, he ends the trip and expects me to request another uber and that he would pick it up. I told him no, because that was my uber and asked frustratedly why he ended my trip. He said he would not take me anywhere until I requested another ride. At this point, I told him to just take me home and he refused. Refusing to let it be, and leave his vehicle, he THREATENS that if I do not exit the vehicle, that he would pull his gun out on me. He exits the drivers side of the vehicle and approaches my door. I have the police on the phone now and when he see's this he steps away from what I assumed he was going to put his hands on me and remove me from the car himself. The only reason I did not file a report, was because my friend who was underage and under the influence was with me. She advised me to hang up and we walked our way home. Very dissappointed in this trip and would like to have more strict rules and guidelines implimented on drivers. Like I said it is the luck of the draw and I have never had this problem with another driver before, but this needs to be addressed. I will be sending an email here soon to document a complaint against that same driver. No one should be made to feel that they are in danger.","date":"2016-03-22T10:37:00Z","name":"Procrastinating Complainer","rating":4,"title":"Luck of the Draw","voteCount":0,"voteSum":0,"viewUsersUserReviewsUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews?userProfileId=497577919","voteUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/rateUserReview?userReviewId=1351657478","reportConcernUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/reportAConcernSubmit?cc=us","reportConcernExplanation":"Provide more details about this review of 'Uber'.

Enter it right before you request a ride. Go to the promotions tab on the app and enter the coupon there. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! \n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver\u2019s face, phone number, and car make and model. It\u2019s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don\u2019t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it\u2019s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn\u2019t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I\u2019m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!

A 7 minute drive from my house to downtown earned my driver exactly $2. That's pointless! As my driver told me, Uber is counting on new drivers who don't know it's a scam and they're counting on the rider to feel guilty and tip extra money so that the con artist that is Uber doesn't have to pay their employees properly. No wonder it took so long to find a ride that night. As my driver informed me, all the experienced drivers got outta dodge. Congratulations, Uber. Your greed ruined a wonderful new alternative to overpriced cabs. I've never used Uber since.\n\nNot to mention, Robert Reich had THIS to say about Uber:\n\n\"Uber drivers are independent contractors as much as Donald Trump is fit to be President: Not at all. Yet Uber continues to battle to deny its drivers basic employee protections such as minimum-wage and overtime, arguing they\u2019re not employees. Baloney.\n\n1. Uber drivers don\u2019t set their own fares or freely choose their own customers. In fact, Uber takes disciplinary action against drivers with low acceptance rates, so drivers have no choice but to respond quickly to ride requests. \n\n2. Uber drivers\u2019 performance is measured and controlled by Uber. Uber knows when drivers have their apps on, to the minute. Uber\u2019s compensation system shows it\u2019s capable of giving its drivers at least minimum wages and providing them overtime protections. \n\n3. Their driving is essential to Uber\u2019s business. Drivers aren\u2019t independent businesses but integral parts of Uber\u2019s multinational business. \n\nIf Uber succeeds in characterizing its employees as independent contractors, few employees in America will be safe; many other employers will follow suit. The following new report by the Economic Policy Institute provides evidence for why Uber drivers are employees \u2013 and why the nation must stop the slide of American workers toward even less job security.\"\n\nBoycott Uber till it's employees seek out a company who treats them better and Uber goes the way of Blockbuster Video!","date":"2016-03-21T05:22:00Z","name":"Nickwritesinthehall","rating":1,"title":"Uber Is A Scam","voteCount":0,"voteSum":0,"viewUsersUserReviewsUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews?userProfileId=296888935","voteUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/rateUserReview?userReviewId=1351059290","reportConcernUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/reportAConcernSubmit?cc=us","reportConcernExplanation":"Provide more details about this review of 'Uber'.

The only thing I dislike is when your location jumps after entering the destination to another block or two away from where you are actually located while you're requesting. You have to be very careful about that and triple check that the blue dot of where you are wanting to be picked up is in the correct spot. Also, if you have a problem with your driver and it left you feeling uncomfortable, and you contact Uber, they will just tell you that they've notified the driver. There's no telling if that actually happened or not, and you leave it at that and pray that the future driver makes you feel safe. Other than all of that, Uber is sometimes great at getting you places quick, but some drivers don't know the city quick routes. You win some, you lose some. If you know a faster way, let them know.","date":"2016-03-21T03:40:00Z","name":"kitkatosaurus","rating":3,"title":"use code \"ubercarmel\" for free $15 ride","voteCount":0,"voteSum":0,"viewUsersUserReviewsUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews?userProfileId=279527232","voteUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/rateUserReview?userReviewId=1351026174","reportConcernUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/reportAConcernSubmit?cc=us","reportConcernExplanation":"Provide more details about this review of 'Uber'.

I have had several terrible experiences. Problems I have had in the past have included blatant sexual harassment, cars that reek of weed or cigarette smoke, incredibly reckless and distracted drivers, and purposefully long routed. Overall, my experience had still been positive so I chose to continue using the service. \n\nHOWEVER, that was until this past weekend when I was charged $48 for a 4 mile trip (no surge pricing) and the an additional $100 for \"damages\". The damages claimed were a small mess on the outside of the car that was meticulously cleaned by myself and a friend upon arriving to our destination. The driver took full advantage of the situation and the support team bounced me back and forth, largely ignoring my side of the story. I got fed up and quit when I received the last email saying that these blanket fees exist to \"protect our drivers\". \n\nI will be using other services from this point out, I cannot tell you how deeply enraged and betrayed I felt after this experience. Your first priority should be to your RIDERS- their safety and trust in your service. Not to the dishonest drivers who lack integrity.","date":"2016-03-21T02:21:00Z","name":"You'll Love it!*","rating":1,"title":"Outrageous","voteCount":1,"voteSum":0,"viewUsersUserReviewsUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews?userProfileId=23048842","voteUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/rateUserReview?userReviewId=1350999879","reportConcernUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/reportAConcernSubmit?cc=us","reportConcernExplanation":"Provide more details about this review of 'Uber'.

What is happening?\nAlso often when I request a ride, I'll get a \"no cars available\", then immediately after its surging and it jumps to double if not triple the price. This makes no sense and is just a way to squeeze money out of customers.\n\nBeen using uber daily for the past few months now, the service has gotten worse and worse since January. The map in the app is totally screwed, it constantly gives drivers the wrong location despite addresses being set for months now. Drivers are getting fewer in number and now it takes several minutes (5-15) to even request the ride, if you don't flat out get a \"no cars available\". Even when I can see multiple cars visible on the map. Considering I use uber to get anywhere I can't walk reasonably, including to work, it's becoming a real pain.\nAlso, there's still no option to tip drivers with uberx-xl-select. You have to hope you have cash in your pocket. I think the fare was reasonable to begin with, but dropping it down for the month of Jan must have alienated a lot of drivers because it seems like there are nowhere near as many uber drivers in the Tampa Bay Area anymore.","date":"2016-03-21T00:23:00Z","name":"BambiRaptorrr","rating":3,"title":"Getting worse","voteCount":0,"voteSum":0,"viewUsersUserReviewsUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews?userProfileId=489550404","voteUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/rateUserReview?userReviewId=1350963180","reportConcernUrl":"https://userpub.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZUserPublishing.woa/wa/reportAConcernSubmit?cc=us","reportConcernExplanation":"Provide more details about this review of 'Uber'.
